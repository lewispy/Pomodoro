# Pomodoro
This app simulates the "Pomodoro technique" of Francesco Cirillo using the tkinter python module. is named after the Italian word for "tomato" because the technique was initially inspired by a tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used during university. The technique is designed to improve productivity and focus by breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Here's a basic outline of how the Pomodoro Technique works:

+ Choose a task: Select a task you want to work on.
+ Set the timer: Set a timer for 25 minutes (this is one "Pomodoro").
+ Work on the task: Focus on the selected task until the timer rings.
+ Take a short break: Take a short break (usually 5 minutes) to relax, stretch, or do something enjoyable.
+Repeat: Repeat the process. After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).

The key principles behind the Pomodoro Technique include:

+ Timeboxing: Breaking work into fixed intervals helps maintain focus and prevents burnout.
+ Forced breaks: Scheduled breaks help prevent mental fatigue and maintain overall productivity.
+ Single-tasking: Focus on one task during each Pomodoro to maximize concentration and efficiency.

While the traditional Pomodoro interval is 25 minutes, individuals can adjust the length based on personal preferences and the nature of their tasks. In this simulation, four long Pomodoros with 15mins breaks each follows the four short Pomodoros of 5 mins breaks each. The aims of this app to help create a sense of urgency during work intervals and promote sustained focus.

The app features a simple but appealing GUI, a buzzer sound that informs users of each Pomodoro round, and a pop-up notification at the end of each Pomodoro.
Enjoy.
